This Project is designed to analyze and visualize student performance data. The Project applies various data processing and statistical methods to gain insights into students' scores and academic performance.

Key Features:
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Imports student score datasets.
Cleans and preprocesses the data for analysis, handling missing values and formatting.
Descriptive Statistics:

Calculates mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and other key metrics to summarize student performance.
Data Visualization:

Generates various plots (e.g., bar graphs, histograms, scatter plots) to visually represent the distribution and trends in the students' scores.
Correlation Analysis:

Examines the relationship between different variables (e.g., study hours, attendance) and student scores using correlation coefficients.
Modeling and Predictions:

Builds predictive models (e.g., linear regression) to predict future student performance based on historical data.
Recommendations:

Provides insights and recommendations for educators and administrators to improve student outcomes.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (if applicable for predictions)
